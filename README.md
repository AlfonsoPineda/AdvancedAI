# Advanced Artificial Intelligence for Data Science Concentration Repository

This repository documents the activities undertaken during the Advanced Artificial Intelligence for Data Science concentration. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including Statistics, Machine Learning, Big Data, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, UI/UX Design, and Cloud technologies. The primary programming languages employed are Python (main), Scala, along with databases such as Cassandra and MongoDB.

## Semester Focus: Medical Applications
The semester's primary focus was on medical applications, applying the aforementioned concepts to real-world scenarios. The two main projects are outlined below:

### 1. Human Activity Recognition with sensors
The initial project involved the development of a classification model. This model predicted the activity a person was engaged in based on data obtained from two accelerometersâ€”one positioned on the lower back of patients and the other on one of their thighs. The activities were classified using machine learning techniques, providing insights into patients' movements and behaviors.

### 2. Left Ventricle Segmentation
The second project had a cardiological emphasis. A U-Net neural network was trained for the segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiograms. Two distinct methodologies were employed: the first based on masks and the second on landmarks. The objective was to compare the effectiveness of both models, determining which approach would be most suitable for future medical applications.
